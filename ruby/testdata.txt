First an introduction to our system:

initialize(name, sell_in, quality)

All items have a SellIn value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item
All items have a Quality value which denotes how valuable the item is
At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item
Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:

Once the sell by date has passed, Quality degrades twice as fast

The Quality of an item is never negative
“Aged Brie” actually increases in Quality the older it gets
The Quality of an item is never more than 50
“Sulfuras”, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in Quality
“Backstage passes”, like aged brie, increases in Quality as it’s SellIn value approaches; 
Quality increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less 
but Quality drops to 0 after the concert

We have recently signed a supplier of conjured items. 
This requires an update to our system:

“Conjured” items degrade in Quality twice as fast as normal items

Inconsistencies:
- The description says quality never exceeds 50, but the golden master says that quality of sulfuras stays at 80
